# WordleTool
*DISCLAIMER: This is just a simple coding project done for fun and learning,
the focus right now is on program optimization by the use of different algorithms and languages (Java and C so far)*

## Wordle solver, returns list of all possible words. The goal in this stage is making the program as optimized as possible. 
#### TODO:
- Finish C implementation, multithreaded solver needs bugfixing
- Optimize C implementation further
- Investigate the advantages of using JNI in the Java implementation
- Order the result list by best words for winning at wordle, still need to think a bit about what means for a word to be a good choice
- Start investigating about turning this into a Firefox extension so it can be used at the original games
